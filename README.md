# EventPulse

EventPulse is a Rust backend library designed for efficient event handling and
notifications. It provides robust storage for events and offers a versatile set
of data aggregation features. With EventPulse, each event can be associated with
a notification feed, supporting various formats for seamless integration.

## Expected Features

- Efficient event handling
- Flexible notification feeds
- Rich set of data aggregation tools
- Designed for scalability and performance

### Roadmap:

- [ ] **Event Management Platform**: Utilize the `event.rs`, `notify.rs`, and
  `tags.rs` modules to create a comprehensive event management platform. Users
  can create events, set up notification preferences (method, frequency), and
  classify events with tags for easy organization and retrieval.

- [ ] **Scheduler for Time-sensitive Operations**: Leverage the `alert.rs`
  module to create a scheduler for time-sensitive operations. Users can set
  precise alerts with intervals, ensuring timely execution of tasks or
  reminders.

- [ ] **Financial Planning Tool**: Combine the `epoch.rs` and `event.rs`
  modules to create a financial planning tool. Users can input financial events
  (income, expenses) and visualize them over different epochs (days, weeks,
  months). Notifications can be set up for important financial events.

- [ ] **Task Manager with Advanced Notification System**: Extend the `notify.rs`
  module to include more sophisticated notification methods (e.g., push
  notifications, Slack integration). Combine it with the `event.rs` module to
  create a task manager with customizable notification settings for each task.

- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**: Utilize the `epoch.rs` module to aggregate event
  data over time periods. Users can track various metrics and visualize trends
  using an analytics dashboard. Notifications can be set up for significant
  changes or milestones.

- [ ] **Time Tracking Application**: Utilize the `time.rs` module to create a
  time tracking application. Users can log hours worked on different tasks and
  receive notifications for approaching deadlines or exceeded time limits.

- [ ] **Collaborative Project Management Tool**: Expand the `tags.rs` module to
  support collaborative tagging of events. Combine it with the `event.rs`
  module to create a project management tool where team members can assign tags
  to tasks, set up notifications, and track progress collaboratively.

### Product ideas leveraging EventPulse and **[Structsy.rs](https://structsy.rs)**

1. **Personal Productivity Companion**: Develop a personal productivity
   companion application that integrates with Structsy for data storage. Users
   can track tasks, events, and alerts, and the application utilizes Structsy's
   snapshot feature to provide users with insights into their productivity
   trends over time. Advanced querying capabilities can enable users to perform
   in-depth analyses of their habits and behaviors.

2. **Health and Wellness Tracker**: Create a health and wellness tracker
   application that allows users to log their daily activities, such as exercise
   routines, meal plans, and sleep schedules. The application utilizes Structsy
   to store user data and offers rich querying capabilities to generate
   personalized health insights and recommendations. Users can set up alerts
   for important health-related events, such as medication reminders or doctor
   appointments.

3. **Financial Portfolio Manager**: Develop a financial portfolio manager
   application that enables users to track their investment portfolios and
   analyze their financial performance over time. Structsy's embedded database
   can store transaction data and portfolio snapshots, allowing users to
   conduct detailed financial analyses and monitor their investment strategies.
   The application can also provide users with alerts for significant market
   events or changes in their portfolio value.

4. **Educational Progress Tracker**: Build an educational progress tracker
   application that helps students and educators monitor academic performance
   and track learning goals. Users can input academic events, such as exams,
   assignments, and study sessions, and the application utilizes Structsy to
   store data and generate insights into learning progress. The application can
   offer personalized study recommendations and reminders for upcoming academic
   deadlines.

5. **Travel Planner and Itinerary Organizer**: Create a travel planner and
   itinerary organizer application that assists users in planning and organizing
   their trips. Users can input travel events, such as flights, accommodations,
   and sightseeing activities, and the application utilizes Structsy to store
   itinerary data and generate travel schedules. The application can offer users
   suggestions for nearby attractions, restaurant recommendations, and real-time
   alerts for flight delays or itinerary changes.

6. **Project Management Dashboard for Teams**: Develop a project management
   dashboard application for teams to collaborate on projects and track progress.
   The application integrates with Structsy to store project data and offers
   advanced querying capabilities to generate reports and insights into project
   performance. Team members can set up alerts for important project milestones,
   task deadlines, and budget constraints, ensuring efficient project management
   and communication.

7. **Real-time Event Monitoring System**: Build a real-time event monitoring
   system that tracks events and alerts users to important changes or anomalies
   in their data. The application utilizes Structsy's snapshot feature to create
   real-time snapshots of data states and employs advanced querying capabilities
   to detect patterns and trends. Users can customize alert criteria and receive
   notifications for critical events in their data, such as sudden spikes in
   website traffic or unusual system behavior.

These product ideas leverage Structsy's embedded database features to create
innovative applications that address various user needs and scenarios. By
integrating Structsy with the existing modules, developers can build robust and
scalable solutions with rich querying capabilities and real-time data processing
capabilities.
